<h2>1) Youtube Is Your Friend</h2>
</div>


<div>
<p>
    The best way to learn how to play D&D is by watching tutorials on Youtube. You have a massive
    of content to watch, ranging from campaigns or different methods of gameplay. Whats even better about using this platform,
    it's free! You may also discover, just like me, many celebrities like Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are fellow role players.

        and a couple of blank ones to update for the future.

    <p>
        One of the joys of the community is that they love publishing their own adventures with different difficulties for beginners and veterans.
        For a beginner DM, these adventures allow players to have quick access, for free, 
        to an adventure readily. A great intro campaign to teach both the new DM and players is, The Death Pit of Moloch. The story is very straight forward
        for everyone and demonstrates all the mechanics of the game, with information at the ready.
        <br>
        Wizards of the Coast also produce pre-made campaign books which can be used by both new and experienced people. These are good but i'd
        strongly suggest finding an easier campaign for
