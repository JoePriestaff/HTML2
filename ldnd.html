    <h3>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h3>
    <p> Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop adventure game brought to life with the worlds 
        greatest tool, the mind! With a lovely set of dice and supreme story telling and guidance from the Dungeon Master (DM),
        you will embark on treturous quests hunting monsters, saving NPC's and most importantly, slaying Dragons!</p>

    <h3>What roles are there?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>This is a question which has been asked to me quite a fair amount and I will always say, depends on which
        role you take!<br>
        <br>
        Woah, did you just read theres more than one role to attending a session?! Thats right, theres 2 roles.<br>
       Theres the player which will work as a part of the team in combat, exploring and problem solving and anything they can think of 
       whilst the other is the Dungeon Master.<br>
       <br>
</div>

       <br>
       <p>What the Dungeon Master does is essentially be the referee for the pod by:<br>
       •Describing Scenery, Surroundings and Narrative<br>
       •Rolling to see if said action happens<br>
       •Rolling for enemies attack and spells<br>
       •Saving Throws (spells which target character specifically)<br>
       •Levelling up characters<br>
       <br>
       What makes the game fun is working with the Dungeon Master by testing the limits of the scenario but also at
       the same time, having a respect to the DM. As long as theres leneancy but still within reason, you'll have a blast.
       At the end of the day, why annoy the one person essentially playing God within your story.
